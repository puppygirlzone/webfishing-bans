# Webfishing Ban List
With the rise in trolls going server to server. I made this list of IDs that I've personally banned due to various reasons listed below. If you wish to ban them then here's the steps.
# How to use
1. Download and install the [LobbyLifeguard](https://github.com/Vildravn/LobbyLifeguard/) mod for Webfishing
2. Download the [leatest release](https://github.com/puppygirlzone/webfishing-bans/releases/latest) and place `LobbyLifeguard.json` in the configs folder (Browse local files on steam, GDWeave/configs)
3. Load the game and know they will all be permabanned
And ya done! Easy as that.
# Contributing
We've made a very special discord just for this project. I love you all but my friends list can only take so much. [Join here](https://discord.gg/fEtGychNbd) and use the new ticketing system. This will also be where the updates are now announced.  
## Changes
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the creation of the [Webfish Airlines Botting Service](https://i.imgur.com/cy7MQlv.png). Puppy has opened her friends list back up in order to help counter this. 
# FAQ
If you have any questions then please read [faq file](docs/faq.md) to see if your question is answered there.

## DO NOT HUNT THESE PEOPLE DOWN
Don't go out of your way to hunt people on this list down. A good portion of this list is innocent but haven't asked to be removed.

I'm not begging, asking nor requiring payment. This is for those who have money they can spare and wish to support me. I know I make a glorified txt file.
